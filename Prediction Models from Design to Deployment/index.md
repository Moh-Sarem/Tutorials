# Specific Goals for this Workshop
## At the end of this workshop, students will be able to:
* Productionize a ML model and put it in action.
* Build a prodiction model using __regression models__ [Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor].
* Evaluate ML models using __Statemodels__ and __SHAP__ (SHapley Additive exPlanations) packages. 
* Build a __Linear Regression model__ from _scratch .
* Inject __python-based ML model__ into __C# VS.net__ Application.
## __Requirements__ <a name="Requirements"></a>
* Students will need either to install __Python software__ ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) are most popular IDE tool) or can run the provided scripts online using __Jupyter__ or __Colabe__ but ample instructions for doing so are provided. 
  - For step-by-step installation instruction, vist and download the document at my [Github link](https://github.com/Moh-Sarem/) 
* Ensure that __sklearn__ version __1.1.3__, __matplotlib__ version __3.6.0__, __pandas__ version __0.11.2__ packages were installed in your PC or the online editor you used. 
* Upgrad __pip__ to the latest version is plus.
* To work with dataset, I strongly recommend you creating an account on [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/)(for more information about Kaggel and the benefits you gain when you create an account there, visit the [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/kaggle-kernels-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide-3db6b1cd7606))
* In case the required packages are not installed or you doubt that they are not properly launched in your editor, run the following script:
```
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
```
* to upgrade the packages, use:
```
!pip install <package_name> --upgrade OR 
!pip install <package_name>==<version>
```
* to check the version number, us:
```
import <package_name as <alise>
print(<alais>.__version__)
```
